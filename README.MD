# Data Cleaning Challenge : FIFA2021

## Introduction
A #datacleaningchallenge was organized recently in the data tech space which gave newbies and intermediate learners the opportunity to work on a data cleaning project. The challenge encouraged every participant to flex their data cleaning skill using any of their preferred tool (e.g, Powerquery, Excel, Python, R, SQL, Google sheets).

> As a participant in the challenge, I used the python editor available in Microsoft Excel to build this data cleaning project using the FIFA 21 dataset provided.

Before I commenced the project, I decided on which tool to use and also the approach for cleaning the data from start to finish. I also went through a data discovery phase where I observed the data quality, profile, and distribution. From the previous process, I discovered that the dataset had the following issues:

- Incorrect data types

- Null and empty values

- Unnecessary special characters

- Columns that should be splitted

- Inconsistent naming convention

- Unwanted columns

## About the Data
